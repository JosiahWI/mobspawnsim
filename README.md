# mobspawnsim
calculates chance of a mob spawning in a certain environment.
There are three types of powers an ore can have:
1: overrides.
Overrides are only for the most powerful ores, these rewrite an effect of another ore of any prioritythey can't override overrides or additions.)
2: additions.
Additions are for moderate and high powered ores, they extend the effect of another ore by adding an extra calculation to an existing effect.
3: effects.
Effects are the most basic power. An effect takes a base chance that a mob will spawn, and applies an equation to it to make a new chance.

When writting effects, please put a comment with each ore to explain its general behavior, or if it doesn't have any general behavior say so.
Please also put a comment by each individual override/addition/effect to explain its behavior.
